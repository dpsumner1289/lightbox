# lightbox

Simple lightbox functionality.

This is a pretty simple lightbox plugin. All you have to do is add the JS file to your script resources, then add the styling file of your choice. I've included both an .scss and a .css file, so whichever you prefer to use, just plug and play.

Obviously you have to include both of these files into the DOM.

Once your files are set up, add a link to the image you want to show up in a lightbox, and add the class 'lightbox_button' to the anchor tag.
